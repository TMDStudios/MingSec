# MingSec

MingSec is a basic home security system that takes advantage of OpenCV for motion detection. 
An image is captured every ten minutes and uploaded to Dropbox. 
If the alarm is tripped, an image is captured and uploaded. A video is then recorded for the duration of the alarm. The video is then uploaded to Dropbox. 
If the internet connection is down, all videos and images are logged, then uploaded to Dropbox when a connection is reestablished. 
MingSec also makes use of a Rest API (not included) to allow the user to request a status check, an image, or a video. These are also uploaded to Dropbox.
